# Video Player with FFmpeg and Pygame
The following is a Python wrapper around FFmpeg for video and audio handling and Pygame for windowing. The video player supports video seek, although jumping around frames may cause video and audio desynchronization.

## TODO:
- Add video processing features, such as filters
- Implement video streaming
